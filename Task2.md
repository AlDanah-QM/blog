## Task 2: Audioguide for a fictional exhibition experience

The task took five full days to complete. While it wasn’t particularly difficult given my experience in full-stack web design, the modular approach of Jekyll posed a challenge in tracing the code and understanding its relationships. Reusing existing code required significant effort to grasp the original programmer's conceptual model. In this case, writing the code from scratch would have been simpler.

Despite the challenges, coding a fictional exhibition with audioguides was an incredible experience. It was demanding, but achieving the desired results brought a great sense of satisfaction. Additionally, this project allowed me to refine my website coding skills. Although the project was intended to result in a static website, I went a step further by incorporating interactive and dynamic features.

The following sections include screenshots and detailed descriptions of the website changes.

### The Color, and 5 Stops for the Main Page

The color scheme was updated to align with the Qatar Museums' color palette, ensuring consistency with their branding across the website. This change was applied not only to the main page but also to the entire design, including the colors of each individual stop. Furthermore, as shown in the following screenshots, three additional stops were added to the original code, with their content populated using YAML files.

### Content Generating and Transilating, AI for Audio and Text

The content, including both text and audio, was generated using AI, specifically large language models (LLMs). The inspiration for the stop content came from a real exhibition at the Museum of Islamic Art (MIA) titled "Splendours of the Atlas: A Voyage Through Morocco’s Heritage." Using this theme, AI was utilized to generate the English text and audio, which was then translated into Arabic. Additionally, an Arabic audio version was also generated using AI.

AI played a pivotal role in this task, contributing to multiple aspects and delivering excellent results. Below are the links to the websites used for generating the audio:
