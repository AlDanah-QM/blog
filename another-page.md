## Task 2: Audioguide for a fictional exhibition experience

The task took five full days to complete. While it wasnâ€™t particularly difficult given my experience in full-stack web design, the modular approach of Jekyll posed a challenge in tracing the code and understanding its relationships. Reusing existing code required significant effort to grasp the original programmer's conceptual model. In this case, writing the code from scratch would have been simpler.

Despite the challenges, coding a fictional exhibition with audioguides was an incredible experience. It was demanding, but achieving the desired results brought a great sense of satisfaction. Additionally, this project allowed me to refine my website coding skills. Although the project was intended to result in a static website, I went a step further by incorporating interactive and dynamic features.

The following sections include screenshots and detailed descriptions of the website changes.
